This folder contains codes to analyse alternative splicing (AS) in NSC, NP and N in the developing mouse neocortex (E14.5).
To identify and quantify AS events (Identification_And_Quantification_Of_AS_Events) Whippet was applied using as reference the gtf obtained by mergine the LRS- and SRS-derived transcriptomes (LRS_SRS.gtf) (see whippet.sh). In addition, to allow discovery of cryptic AS events, an alignment file derived by the merging of all SRS replicated aligned to the LRS_SRS.gtf file is provided to the Whippet code (see alignment_all.sh).
