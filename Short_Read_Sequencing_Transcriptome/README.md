This folder contains the code to assemble a transcriptome from paired-end bulk short-reads sequencing data using hisat2 and stringtie.   

For this assembly, an Ensembl mm10 gtf file filtered for trasncripts with high support level (TSL 1 or 2) was used as a reference: "mm10_filtered.gtf". The reference fasta file "Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa" was obtained from Ensembl.

The data come from bulk short-read sequencing of sorted neural stem cells (NSC), committed neural progenitors (NP) and newborn neurons (N) from lateral neocortices of developing mouse brains at embryonic day (E) 14.5. Sequencing was performed in triplicate.
